# Happy Hacktoberfest!

We're participating in Hacktoberfest this year! If you're not familiar with it, it's a month-long celebration of open source software. You can read more about it [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

We're looking for contributors to help us with our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/countr) and we'll be giving away some Discord Nitro codes to the best contributions! We'll be giving away 3 codes, for the best 3 contributions.


## How to contribute

It can be some code changes, some documentation changes, some bug fixes, anything that helps us improve our projects! You can find our repositories [here](https://github.com/orgs/countr/repositories). If you're not sure where to start, you can check out our [issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acountr+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Adependencies) and see if there's anything you can help with. If you're not sure how to contribute, you can also ask us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2Z8Y4Z5) and we'll be happy to help you out!


## Quality of contributions

We expect good quality of contributions, and the "top three" contributors are not necessarily the ones who contributed the most, but the ones who contributed the best. We'll be looking at the quality of the code, the quality of the documentation, the quality of the bug report, etc.

Other than that, happy hacktoberfest and happy counting!
