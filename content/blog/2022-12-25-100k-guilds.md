# Countr is now counting in 100,000 guilds

We're proud to announce that Countr is now counting in 100,000 guilds! We've come a long way since we first launched Countr back in July 2018, and we're excited to see what the future holds. We'd like to thank everyone who has been using Countr, and we hope you continue to enjoy Countr for years to come!

## What's next?

As the holidays are coming up, we're going to be taking a break from development for a few weeks. We'll be back in the new year with some exciting new features, and we can't wait to share them with you all. Our plans for 2023 are to focus more on the user experience, and to make Countr more accessible to everyone!

You can check out our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/countr/countr/issues) to see what we're working on. If you have any suggestions, feel free to add a new issue - we're always looking for new ideas!


## Server upgrade

We now have a new server! This one's beefy, and we're going to cover more of the server over on the new [Promise Solutions blog](https://promise.solutions/blog). I'm also going to be writing up on the infrastructure of the server, if anyone is curious of course. Stay tuned!


Happy holidays everyone, and we'll see you in the new year! ðŸŽ‰
