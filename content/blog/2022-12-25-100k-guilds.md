# Countr is now counting in 100,000 guilds

We're proud to announce that Countr is now counting in 100,000 guilds! This is a huge milestone for us, and we're very happy to have reached it. We'd like to thank all of our users for their support, and we hope to continue to provide a great experience for you all.


## What's next?

As the holidays are coming up, we're going to be taking a break from development for a few weeks. We'll be back in the new year with some exciting new features, and we can't wait to share them with you all. Our plans for 2023 is to focus more on the user experience, and to make Countr more accessible to everyone!
