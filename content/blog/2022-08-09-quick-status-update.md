# Quick status update

There's currently some issues with interactions, we're working to identify the problem and solve it. It doesn't happen in our test environment though, it's quite rare and happens after some time, so we've increased our logging capabilities on the bot and, hopefully, we'll be able to identify it as soon as possible.
