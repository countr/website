# Introducing token scanner

Countr is obviously just a counting bot, but it doesn't hurt making communities more safe. That's why we're introducing a new feature: token scanner.

By using Countr in your server, Countr will scan all the messages in your server for Discord bot tokens. If it finds one, it will reset the token, so it can't be used by anyone else.


## Why?

As we said above, Countr is just a counting bot, but we want to make communities on Discord more safe. We've seen a lot of people getting their tokens stolen, and we want to help prevent that. We're not doing this for any other reason than to make communities more safe.

If you're against this then you can simply remove Countr from your server.

This is also added to our privacy policy, which you can read [here](/privacy).
