# Position roles are finally here!

It's been requested for a while now, and we're finally ready to release it. Position roles are a new type of role that is given to someone based on their position on the leaderboard. For example, if you have a role called "Top Counter" then this can be given to the person in first place on the leaderboard.

It's still in BETA so let us know if you have any issues!
