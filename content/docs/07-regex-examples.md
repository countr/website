# Regex Examples

You can currently use regex in regex filters and in flows. We've created a list of common regex filters that you can copy and paste to customize Countr for your needs.

- Get info on how to create your own custom regex [here](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-regular-expressions/#regular-expressions-choices).
- Test regex filters [here](https://regexr.com/). Use the flag "global".
- If you found a neat regex you want to add to the list then you can create a pull request [here](https://github.com/countr/docs/blob/master/docs/regex-examples.md).

| Regex | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `duck\|goose` | words "duck" or "goose" |
| `[A-Z]` | all capital letters |
| `[A-Ca-cX-Zx-z]` | letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, regardless of capitalization |
| `^\d*(69)( \|$)` | any number ending in 69 |
