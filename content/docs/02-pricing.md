# Pricing
Countr is not free for us to host, as the bill is rising we need some supporters. We have multiple ways on how you can support us, continue reading to know how!

## Premium-only features
- Access to the Premium bot with less downtime, faster response time and faster startup time if we ever have an outage.
- Early access to fancy new beta features
- Premium support on our support server, and a fancy role for your support!
- Live scoreboard (like `c!top`, but updates every minute)
- More flows, triggers and actions (25 of each)

## How to get Premium
You can get Premium in two ways: [on Patreon](https://patreon.com/promises) or through a Nitro boost in our support server.

:::caution Warning

- You must be in the support server to get your rewards, this is due to our automated credits system.
- You must have connected your Discord to Patreon to get your Patreon-rewards. Get help from [this guide](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Get-my-Discord-role#h_21f22930-84c5-4950-b6b1-3e83312f66dc) made by Patreon themselves.
- No refunds are accepted, especially Nitro boosts as these don't directly support us but rather the Discord server.
- The owner of the server must be the one donating.

:::note

- All Premium features are only accessible through the Premium bot.
- It can take up to five minutes for the bot to be available.
- If you move from the Premium bot to Countr, or vice versa, you will still keep the data for the server. They are both connected to the same- database, so all data is still being stored. Don't panic!
