## How to manage your guild data {#how}

You can use the `/data export all` command to extract your guild's data. You can also extract your counting channel's flows individually using the `/data export flow/flows` commands, and also extract your scores table using the `/data export scores` command.

You can also import a flow or a scores table using the `/data import flow` and `/data import scores` commands.

If you want to reset your guild's data, you can use the `/data reset` command.
