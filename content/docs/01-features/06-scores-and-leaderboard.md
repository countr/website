# Scores & Leaderboard

We have implemented a score table that keeps track of how many times each user has counted in the counting channel.

You can use the `/scores modify` command to modify the score of a user. You can also prune the list by running `/scores prune`, this will remove everyone from the scores table that have left your server.


## Leaderboard {#view}

You can view the scores table with the `/leaderboard` command.


## Liveboard (live leaderboard) {#live}

You can get a live leaderboard by purchasing [Premium](../02-premium.md)
