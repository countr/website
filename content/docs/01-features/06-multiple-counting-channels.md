# Multiple Counting Channels

With Countr, you can have up to 2 counting channels for free, and up to 5 counting channels with Premium. If you have more than one counting channel, some commands might require you to use the `/select` command to specify which counting channel you are referring to.

Your selected counting channel is remembered for 24 hours, after which you will need to use the `/select` command again. You can also run the original command in the counting channel itself to avoid having to select it and/or override your already-selected counting channel. However, some commands are required to be run outside of the counting channel, so you will need to select it first.

If Countr needs you to select a counting channel, it will let you know. Simply type `/select` to select a counting channel, and then run the command again.
