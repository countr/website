# Position roles

A position role is a role that is applied to someone based on their position on the leaderboard. For example, if you have a role called "Top Counter" then this can be given to the person in first place on the leaderboard.


## How to set up {#how}

You can set up a new position role using the `/positionroles set` command. You can list all your position roles, and also delete some if you want, with `/positionroles list`.
