# Scores & Leaderboard

Countr keeps track of how many times each user has counted in the counting channel, and can display this information in a score table and leaderboard.


## How to modify {#modify}

To modify a user's score manually, use the `/scores modify` command. This command allows you to add or subtract points from a user's score. You can also prune the score table with the `/scores prune` command, which removes users who have left your server from the table.


## Leaderboard {#view}

To view the score table, use the `/leaderboard` command. This command displays the top 25 users with the highest scores, along with their scores and positions on the leaderboard. You can also view individual scores with the `/user` command.

### Users that have left the server {#users-left}

If a user has left the server, their score will still show on the leaderboard but their `@mention` might not work correctly. If you want to remove users that have left the server from the leaderboard, use the `/scores prune` command.


## Liveboard (live leaderboard) {#live}

The Liveboard is a premium feature that automatically updates every 5 minutes. To access the Liveboard, you need to purchase [Premium](../03-premium.md). The Liveboard displays the top 25 users with the highest scores, along with their scores and positions on the leaderboard.
