# Scores & Leaderboard

Countr keeps track of how many times each user has counted in the counting channel, and displays this information in a score table and leaderboard.


## How to modify {#modify}

To modify a user's score, use the `/scores modify` command. This command allows you to add or subtract points from a user's score. You can also prune the score table by running `/scores prune`, which removes users who have left your server from the table.


## Leaderboard {#view}

To view the score table, use the `/leaderboard` command. This command displays the top 25 users with the highest scores, along with their scores and positions on the leaderboard. You can also view individual scores with the `/user` command.


## Liveboard (live leaderboard) {#live}

The Liveboard is a premium feature that automatically updates every 5 minutes. To access the Liveboard, you need to purchase Premium. The Liveboard displays the top 25 users with the highest scores, along with their scores and positions on the leaderboard.
