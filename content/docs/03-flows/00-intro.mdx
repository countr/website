# Intro

A flow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more actions. It sounds complicated, but we've tried to make it as user-friendly as we can with our flow editor.

Simply put, a flow is a list of triggers and actions, and whenever one of those triggers is triggered, the flow will run all the actions.

## How to create a flow

        I will guide you through creating a flow. It is very easy to set one up, and you can customize flows a lot as well!
        <br/><br/>
        Here's some things to note:<br/>
        ‚Ä¢ <Bold>Any trigger</Bold> will run <Bold>all actions</Bold>. So if you want to give out role rewards, you need to set up a flow per reward.<br/>
        ‚Ä¢ Actions run <Bold>asynchronously</Bold>, meaning that your first action will run, and then your second, and then your third etc.<br/>
        ‚Ä¢ If an action fails, it will just continue on to the next action.

When you first run the command `/flows create`, this message will come up. Looks like a lot, and looks quite advanced, but it's actually pretty simple and user friendly.

You are first greeted with this welcome message. It's a bit long, but it's a good way to get started. Most importantly though, **any trigger** will run **all actions**. So if you want role rewards or anything like that, you will need a flow for each role you want to give out.

Click Next to go to the next step. There are in total four steps. Step 2 and 3 is where you configure your flow, and step 4 is where you can give your flow a name or toggle it as well. After step 4, you can save the flow.

## Ideas

We've collected a few ideas for your server here. You can of course make your own flow however you'd like, but here are a few ideas to help get you started.

* **Role rewards:** Give out a role to people that counted a total of 1000 counts or more.
* **Milestone pin:** Pin every 1000th count in the channel.
