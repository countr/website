# Limits

You can have 3 triggers and 10 actions per flow, and 25 flows total on your server. Premium gets 25 of each.

You might be wondering why we have these limitations. It's simply because the more triggers, actions and flows a server has, the more processing power will it use to process a count. With over a million counts every week, this adds up a lot. We feel like this limit is plenty for the average Discord user, but if you want to go completely insane then you can do that with the Premium solution for only $1/month.
