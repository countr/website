# Triggers

A trigger is something that will activate and run the flow. If you're a premium user and have multiple triggers, any one of the triggers can activate the flow.

Available triggers:

<Discord>
  <Message profile="countr">
    <Command slot="reply" profile="promise" command="/flows edit"></Command>
    <Embed embedTitle="Select Action" color="#bd4732">
      <Description slot="description">
        0 - <b>Clear/Empty</b>
        <br />This will add a role to the user who triggered this flow.
        <br /><br />
        1 - <b>Give a role to the user</b>
        <br />This will add a role to the user who triggered this flow.
        <br /><br />
        2 - <b>Take a role away from the user</b>
        <br />This will remove a role from the user who triggered this flow.
        <br /><br />
        3 - <b>Remove everyone from a role</b>
        <br />This will remove everyone from this role.
        <br /> Note: This might not remove everyone from the role due to caching. Some inactive users might not lose their role.
        <br /><br />
        4 - <b>Pin the count message</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        5 - <b>Send a message</b>
        <br />This will send a message in a channel (it doesn't have to be the counting channel!)
        <br /><br />
        6 - <b>Lock the counting channel</b>
        <br />This will lock the counting channel for the everyone-role, and will be read-only.
        <br /><br />
        7 - <b>Reset the current count</b>
