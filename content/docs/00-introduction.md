# Introduction

Countr is an advanced counting bot which can manage a counting channel in your guild.


## What is a counting channel? {#explanation}

A counting channel is a channel where you can count. That is the simple explanation. However, we have a vast amount of features that can be used in a counting channel. [Check them out here!](./category/features)


## Create your first counting channel {#get-started}

  1. Add the bot with [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=467377486141980682&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=395942423568).
  2. Use `/channels new` to create a new counting channel, or link a pre-existing channel with `/channels link`.
  3. Count in the counting channel.

Yeah, it's actually that simple to set up. *mic drop* ðŸŽ¤


## Purpose

There is a lot of multi-purpose bots out there, some of them may also include a simple counting setup. What's wrong about multi-purpose is that they're focused on so many things that some of the features are poorly executed and very limited. Countr is not multi-purpose, it's only focused on counting. This means Countr has much more counting features than other bots.

Countr has a simple setup but also has cool advanced features, such as flows, modules and more.
