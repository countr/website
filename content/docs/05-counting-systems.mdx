# Counting systems

The default is the [decimal system](#decimal), we all know this one. You count from 0 to 9, and then add a 1 at the end.

There's more than one way to count though.

## List of supported systems

### Decimal

The default counting system. Also known as the base-10 system.

### Hexadecimal

Count 0-9 and then A-F. Also known as the base-16 system.

  <Message>27DA</Message>
  <Message>27DB</Message>
</Discord>

### Binary

Count in 0s and 1s. Also known as the base-2 system.

  <Message>1100111</Message>
  <Message>1101000</Message>
</Discord>

### Base36

Count 0-9 and then A-Z. This is a bit tricky.

  <Message>271l</Message>
  <Message>271m</Message>
</Discord>

### Base64

Count 0-9 and then A-Z and then a-z. Might include a few other characters like equals at the end. Good luck with this one.

</Discord>

### Roman

Count in roman numerals. Uses the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, M.

Note: Traditionally, the highest number you can represent using roman numerals is 3,999. However, the bot accepts higher values by just adding more M's.

## How do I know what number I'm on?

When you run `/count`, you get information about the current number and what your next number is as well. This is quite handy for complex systems like the [base64-system](#base64)!
