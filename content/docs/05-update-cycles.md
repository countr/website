# Update cycles

We update Countr every week, however because it takes time to deploy to all of our clusters, we try to group up updates and deploy them together, usually once or twice every week.

Countr Premium gets updates almost instantly as it's much faster to deploy to one cluster with one shard, versus ten individual clusters with ten shards each. This is the primary reason why Countr Premium get features earlier. It's a smaller environment that is much faster to deploy to.

We have a [projects-board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/countr/projects/1/views/2) that you can view to see what is deployed and what is waiting for deployment.
