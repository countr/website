## How to Get Premium {#how}

You can get Premium in two ways: [through Patreon](https://patreon.com/promises) or by Nitro boosting our [support server](https://promise.solutions/discord). Patreon has different tiers with different amounts of server slots, while boosting gets you one slot only. You can also have a Patreon tier while boosting, as server slots add up.

Please note that you must be in the [support server](https://promise.solutions/discord) to get your rewards, as our automated credits system requires it. If you're a Patron, you need to have your Discord account connected to your Patreon to receive your rewards. Read more about that on [this guide](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Get-my-Discord-role#h_21f22930-84c5-4950-b6b1-3e83312f66dc). It might take some time for Patreon to update your roles, so please be patient. If you're a Patron and you're not receiving your rewards after some time, please let us know and we'll help you out.

### Add Premium to Your Server {#how-to-add}

In the [support server](https://promise.solutions/discord), you'll have access to the `/server add` and `/server remove` commands. Using these commands, you can add the server(s) you want to be granted Premium access. You don't need to be the server owner or anything, and you don't even need to be in the server you want to give Premium to. Just know that if you add someone else's server, they will get access to Premium and use up one of your server slots.

After you've done that, you can ask one of the support members for an invite link. You can list all your servers by right-clicking your profile, going to Apps in the dropdown, and then clicking "See premium information". If you're unsure how to do this, please let us know.

## Refunds Policy {#refunds}

We do not offer refunds.

If your subscription ends or you've changed your mind later and want or need to downgrade to the free bot, you can safely do so by kicking the Countr Premium bot and adding the free bot again. Both bots use the same database, so your data is safe and not lost during the transition.
