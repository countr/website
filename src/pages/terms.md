# Terms of Service

## 1. Introduction {#introduction}

Please read these Terms of Service (these "Terms") carefully as they govern your use of
Promise Solutions’ (the “Service Provider”) services through Countr (the “Bot”), an application
on the Discord platform.

Use of Countr may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Promise
Solutions, which are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms.

By using Countr or by otherwise interacting with it in any way, you agree to these Terms. If
you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Countr bot application in any
capacity.


## 2. Availability of Service {#availability-of-service}

The Service Provider cannot assuredly guarantee that you will have continuous uninterrupted
access to Countr. For whatever reason, at any time, the Bot may be made unavailable for
maintenance or may unexpectedly stop responding to user-invoked instructions
(“Commands”).

You must also be cognisant that unavailability may sometimes be out of the control of the
Bot’s maintainers and could instead be reliant on Discord’s Application Programming
Interface (“API”) having an outage. In these instances, the Service Provider will make every
reasonable effort to notify its users.

Alternatively, Promise Solutions reserves the right to temporarily or permanently revoke
access to the Bot, on multiple bases, including servers, channels, and users, for any, or no,
reason, though users have a reasonable assumption to believe that it will be due to what has
been determined as misuse. This can happen where a user’s interactions with the Bot have
been determined to be with malicious aforethought, and if their access to the Bot remained,
there may be an existing threat to the upkeep of the Bot.


## 3. Our Promise to you {#our-promise-to-you}

As the Service Provider, we will act with professional diligence and will aim to resolve any
disputes with you amicably. We can be held to the standard that our support representatives
and any associated officials will respond to queries with their best knowledge on the topic
and will approach senior representatives if any disambiguation is required. Likewise, we
expect that you will respect our support representatives and all officials that represent
Countr or Promise Solutions.


## 4. Privacy Policy {#privacy-policy}

Promise Solutions maintains a Privacy Policy, which is a legal document which defines how
Promise Solutions (the “Data Controller”) handles and stores your data, what data is stored, as
well as conditions for erasure and anonymisation of existing information. You can access
Countr’s Privacy Policy by clicking [here](/privacy).


## 5. Changes to these Terms {#changes-to-these-terms}

Promise Solutions may apply amendments, omissions, or addendums to this Terms of Service
document at any time, for whatever, or no, reason. The Service Provider will make every
reasonable effort to notify its users of significant changes to the Terms of Service document.
Minor amendments, omissions, or addendums may not be announced in an official capacity.


## 6. Right to Disambiguation {#right-to-disambiguation}

You have the right to disambiguation, meaning that you can ask us for clarification about
anything mentioned in this document and we can explain to you what it means in more
accessible terminology, though we have made a reasonable effort to do so herein. You can
contact us at [terms@countr.xyz](mailto:terms@countr.xyz).


## 7. Termination {#termination}

Promise Solutions, as well as you, have the right to terminate these Terms at any time, for
whatever, or no reason, without consequence. This does not invalidate any actions that may
have been performed prior to the activation of the Termination clause. Terminating this
agreement also means that Promise Solutions reserves the right to revoke your access to the
Bot. For information about how your data is handled, refer to Countr’s [Privacy Policy](/privacy).
