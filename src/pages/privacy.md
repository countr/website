# Privacy Policy

## 1. Overview

Promise Solutions has developed this Privacy Policy to explain how Countr, as a Data Controller, may collect, retain, process, share and transfer your User Data when you visit our Sites or use our Services. This Privacy Policy applies to your User Data when you visit Sites or use Services, and is not applicable to online websites or services that we do not own or have any degree of control over.
This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in obtaining information about our privacy practices and to help you understand your privacy choices and their exhaustive capacities when you use our Sites and Services.
We have defined some terms that we use throughout the Privacy Policy. You can find the meaning of a capitalised term in the Definitions section, located at the bottom of this document.
We encourage you, the User, to read the entirety of this Privacy Policy prior to use of any of our Services. You are assumed liability for any potential damages caused due to failure to read this comprehensive legal document.
Guild and User information is stored with respect to perpetuity. As per our desire to allow Users to have full control over how their data is managed, you are afforded the right of erasure or deletion of relevant information to you. This process can be initiated by sending us an email in correspondence with this regulation or through running c!factoryreset on a server that Countr is a member of. This is facilitated through sending a message, where ‘c!’ is the default prefix that invokes Countr to respond to and process the User’s request.
Please contact us if you have any questions about our privacy practices that are not addressed in this Privacy Policy through [privacy@countr.xyz](mailto:privacy@countr.xyz).
